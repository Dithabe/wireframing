# wireframing
<h2>What is Wireframing?</h2>
<p>Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process, serving as a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application. It outlines the basic structure and layout without delving into detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images.</p>
<p>Wireframes focus on the placement of elements, navigation flow, and overall user interface structure.</p>

<h2>Key elements in a Wireframe</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Layout structure - defines the arrangement of elements on the page. Items in the layout structure include the placement of headers, images, text block and buttons.</li>
  <li>Navigation - shows how users will move through the site or application. Items in navigation include the placement of menus, tabs, and other navigation elements.</li>
  <li>Content Placement - indicates where text, images, and other content will be positioned. Items include the font size, bold text, and visual cues</li>
  <li>Functionality - outlines key functionalities and interactions. Items here would be the process flow of a password reset, from the user selecting email/SMS to them getting the OTP and finally resetting their password.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Types of Wireframes.</h2>
<h3>High-Fidelity vs Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
<p>Low-Fidelity wireframes are simple sketches or basic digital layouts focusing on overall structure and functionality without detailed design. In contrast, high-Fidelity wireframes are more detailed and refined versions, often closer to the final design, including more specific layout and design elements.</p>
<p>Low-fidelity wireframes are best used in the early stages of a project to quickly explore and test concepts, while high-fidelity wireframes are more suitable for later stages to refine designs and get detailed feedback.</p>

<h3>Which kind of Wireframe is used in the design?</h3>
<p>The design in question is using a High-Fidelity wireframe. Effort was placed in the design beyond just a basic level, and the design reveals how a product will look at project completion. The design also includes colours and present screens that are close to how they would appear in the final version of the application.</p>

<h2>Benefits of Wireframing</h2>
<p>Wireframing offers numerous benefits for design projects primarily by helping visualize structure, clarify interface features, and push usability to the forefront.</p>
<p>Wireframing serves as a communication tool among team members, clients, and stakeholders, ensuring everyone is on the same page regarding the design and functionality. Given the visual nature of wireframing, in a stakeholder meeting, all parties present will be able to see the process flow and whoever is presenting can talk through the visual images to ensure the points are driven home. The client also has the opportunity to state their likes and concerns thereby strengthening the communication between all parties involved.</p>

<h2>Real World application of Wireframing</h2>
<p>In a design review session, the client had expressed desires to change the checkout flow process of their system. They wanted the delivery page to come after the payments page which was a wild request. They were adament that the process would enhance the user experience. The existing system was designed in such a way that the payments section was the last part of the checkout journey. The UX designer on the project was able to quickly edit the existing flow on Figma to the client's request. We then had to explain how the delivery address could be manipulated after payment was made and they were able to see in real-time on Figma. We then suggested for the delivery information to be displayed on the payments page so the user can confirm their address while making payment. The designer was then able to make that tweek on Figma for both desktop and mobile view. The client was happier with this approach and we avoided going against the system flow through wireframing in real-time. </p>
